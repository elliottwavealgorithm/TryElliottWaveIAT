# Try Elliott Wave – Research MVP

This repository contains the early-stage MVP of **TryElliottWave**, a research project exploring how traders draw and validate Elliott Wave structures. The system integrates with TradingView’s Advanced Charts library (requested) to capture user-created drawings and store them as structured data for research and potential machine learning applications.

## Objectives

- Allow users to draw Elliott Waves and Fibonacci structures directly on charts.
- Programmatically capture each drawing (anchor points, structure, timestamps).
- Validate structures against Elliott Wave principles in real time.
- Store datasets for research and potential ML/LLM training.
- Provide a feedback engine to help students and traders improve their technical analysis.

## Status

- MVP live at: [https://www.tryelliottwave.com](https://www.tryelliottwave.com)
- Repository currently demonstrates core integration logic and storage workflow.
- Project supported by **Instituto de Análisis Técnico Bursátil (IAT)** in Mexico, an educational partner of TradingView.

## Notes

- The project is currently for educational and research purposes, in collaboration with IAT (Instituto de Análisis Técnico Bursátil).
- There is no trading execution or brokerage integration at this stage.
- If validated successfully, the project could evolve into a public platform with commercial applications, in which case a proper commercial license from TradingView would be pursued.
